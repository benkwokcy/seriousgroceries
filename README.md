## Serious Groceries - a flyer scraping website for home cooks.

This repository contains the files for generating the [SeriousGroceries website](https://seriousgroceries.firebaseapp.com/).

### About

Serious Groceries helps you decide what to cook for a meal on a limited budget in Victoria. 

It does this by scraping the sales flyers of nearby grocery stores and matching the data against a personal library
of dish recipes chosen by the user. This way, you can easily see the top dishes that can be shopped for cheaply.

Unlike flyer aggregation apps like Flipp, this app recommends specific dishes to cook, making the userâ€™s life easier. 
In contrast to grocery organization apps and recipe recommendation apps like Pepperplate, CookSmarts, Plan to Eat, 
and Paprika, this app takes into account the items that are currently on sale nearby.
