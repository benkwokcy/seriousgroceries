## Serious Groceries - a flyer scraping website for cooks.

Serious Groceries relieves the struggle of deciding what to eat for dinner on a limited budget in Victoria. 

Every day, it reads the flyers of nearby grocery stores and matches the results with a personal library of dishes selected by you.
This way, you can easily see the top dishes that can be shopped for cheaply.

Unlike flyer aggregation apps like Flipp, this app recommends specific dishes to cook, making the userâ€™s life easier. In contrast to grocery organization apps and recipe recommendation apps like Pepperplate, CookSmarts, Plan to Eat, and Paprika, this app takes into account the items that are currently on sale nearby.
