## Serious Groceries - a flyer scraping website for home cooks.

This repository contains the files for generating the [SeriousGroceries website](https://www.seriousgroceries.com/).

### About

Serious Groceries combines the functionality of flyer apps (Flipp) and grocery apps (Pepperplate, CookSmarts, Plan to Eat
Paprika) to help you decide what to cook for a meal on a limited budget in Victoria. 

It does this by scraping the flyers of nearby grocery stores and matching the data against a set of recipes that you choose. This way, you can easily see the top dishes that can be shopped for cheaply.
